Training (3) and testing data (4) were generated with (1) from files downloaded from 
https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository ( ID=TCGA-COAD, Platform = Illumina Human Methylation 450).  These were read in by the ipython notebook (2) to fit our HMMs under different conditions. HMM results were then plotted using (1).
